# Software Startup Madness

Have you ever been confused about the job titles you sometimes find in the software industry? Have they left you wondering exactly who is in charge of what? **Software Startup Madness** is a multiplayer game, played in the browser, in which you assume a role in a fictional software startup. But your real job title is often hidden from you, and you will trade jobs frequently, which means you may have to bluff and cheat your way to job success!

-------------------------

Software Startup Madness is an HTML, phone browser port of the card game [Mascarade](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/139030/mascarade), designed by Bruno Faidutti and distributed by Repos Production in 2013. There are a few versions of Mascarade saved as repositories on GitHub, but only one incomplete JavaScript version, and it looks as though many of the other versions are either run on the command line or incomplete. A primary goal of this personal project will be to use Javascript (and libraries and frameworks), node.js, socket.io, and Heroku to create client- and server-side code that will allow players to play on the internet.
